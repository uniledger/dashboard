The following files can be safely removed as they're no longer needed after refactoring:

1. src/components/templates/TemplatesView.js - Redundant since the application has been updated to use TemplatesPage.js instead

To remove these files, run:
git rm src/components/templates/TemplatesView.js
git commit -m "Remove unused TemplatesView.js file after refactoring"
